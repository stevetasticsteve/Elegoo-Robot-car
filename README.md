Code so Elegoo Robot car V3.0 can do new things

I taught myself Python a couple of years ago and have been playing around with it. I wanted to move coding into the real world and actually get code to do stuff. I recieved an Elegoo Robot Car (V3.0) kit as a gift and after putting together and running the provided scripts I attempted to write some of my own
I've written a code to use the ultrasound sensor to scan the room, send the data by serial over USB to python and then used pygame to draw a sonar screen.

It's buggy, but it works
